Instrumentation tests have several benefits:

User Interface Validation:
    They allow you to interact with UI components and validate their behavior,
    ensuring that the app's user interface is functioning correctly.
End-to-End Testing:
    They can cover entire user flows, helping verify the integration of different components and features.
Regression Testing:
    Instrumentation tests can be part of your automated testing suite,
    providing a safety net to catch regressions as the codebase evolves.
Robustness:
    They test the app in a real device or emulator environment, making them more realistic and reliable.
Documentation:
    Tests serve as documentation for expected app behavior and usage.
